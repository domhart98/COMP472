# COMP472 - Assignment 1

This code is to allow us to compare the performance metrics of various learning models, given a dataset.

1) User selects 1 of the 6 learning models 

2) User selects 1 of 2 data sets to train the selected model on

3) A histogram showing the frequency of each class in the training data is plotted and shown

4) The classification report, containing the performance metrics for that model on the training data, is displayed

5) The confusion matrix is also displayed

6) The trained model is fitted to the test instances, and an ndarray containing the predicted results is produced

7) Finally, the classification report, the confusion matrix, and the predicted classes for each instance are outputted 
   to an appropriately named csv file.
